Positioning in CSS
Positioning is the arranging of elements in a certain way.
Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently.
For example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport
Positioning allows us to manipulate how we arrange items against the default browser setting.
top, bottom, left, and right are used to specify exactly where to move/arrange element at. 
Relative positioning places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position
Absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it .
static positioning means that every element has a static position by default, so the element will stick to the normal page flow.
Elements placed in static position are not affected by the right,left,top or bottom properties.
Fixed positioning is when an element is positioned relative to the browser window,and that element is usually removed from the normal flow,that element can also overlap other elements
